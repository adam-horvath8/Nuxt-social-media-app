# Whisper-web

Whisper Web is my first full-stuck project. It is a Twitter clone. The front-end is made in the Nuxt.js framework, which is based on Vue.js. The back-end is made with Node.js and the Express framework. I used Prisma as an ORM that communicates with the PostgreSQL database. The project is written in Typescript.
